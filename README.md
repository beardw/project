# DS Toolbox Project

This project was created for the DS Toolbox Assignment #6.

Here we learnt about file structure and applied that to a collection of sample files. 
In additional, using Conda helped further understand the process of creating virtual environments. 

The files in this repo were used to aid answering the questions for this assignment.

To apply our newly acquired skills, we used Git Bash to navigate and updated our files. It was used to explore and navigate Conda, as well.

Both GitHub and JupyterLab were used alternatively, throughout the assignment, to help in getting more familiar with each platform.
